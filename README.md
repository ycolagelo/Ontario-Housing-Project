##  OWN A SHARE OF ONTARIO HOUSING MARKET AND START BUILDING YOUR WEALTH NOW!

<br />

# Description

The **PIECE OF CAKE** Project is a platform that allows Canadians to start owing a piece of property in Ontario.

It has become common knowledge that the Ontario real estate prices have been steadily rising for a number of years, and our data analysis verifies that. This is a POTENTIAL PROBLEM, because not every hard-working individual may be able to afford to being a home-owner. Are Ontarians being priced out of home-ownership?? Is this happening fast or slow? What will the near future-look like for those trying to get on-board?

These are the sort of questions our project is here to resolve - and we have a Solution as well!



# Data Analysis

Our team has gathered statistical data from various sources including but not limited to StatsCan, CREA, and Kaggle and performed the following analysis to determine results.


- Pandas in Python to import and preview the data
- Parse, Slice, and Concatenate the data using Python
- Visualize the data using Matplotlib, Hvplot, Fiona, PyViz



Here are the key take-aways:

- Housing Data in Ontario in a 5 year span up to 2021 has demonstrated a steady rise in prices across all types of housinng, of an average 14% annually and total of 70%
- In the meantime, Income Data in Ontario in a 4 year span up to 2020 has demonstrated a rise (in real-terms) of an average of 1.7% and a total of 6.8% percent. That is roughly a 10-fold difference with the rate of the Housing Data.
- We can see that at this rate, housing affordability will become out of reach for most Ontario residents


# Solution

1) Our team demonstrates how long it will take to save up for a downpayment
2) How much money should you make if you want the levels of affordability from 5 years ago?
3) BEST SOLUTION - Invest with "PIECE OF CAKE"!!!
